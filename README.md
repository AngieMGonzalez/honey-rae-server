- `python3 manage.py migrate` creates tables in DB

- packages are imported and defining routes

# CREATE POST reminder
- Now that you have a model, a view, a serializer, and the URL defining the route for 
[resource], the final step is to create a [resource] or two and then get them.

# Fixtures
- JSON files that contain some data for your database. Useful for initial creation of a development database, or for testing.
- set up your project with some fixtures so that you can provide some *initial, or seed, data* for your database, without the need to write any INSERT INTO statements in a SQL file
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/initial-data/
- we are adding fixtures in JSON
- add info on `seed_database.sh` file
- https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-llc/blob/cohort-62/book-3-levelup/chapters/HR_SEED_DB.md
- `chmod u+x ./seed_database.sh` to make executable script
- https://linuxhandbook.com/make-file-executable/
- then run `./seed_database.sh` to install fixtures

## getting all customers from api 
- Adding the URL
So far weâ€™ve set up the view and serializer but not which URL to use for the view. We need to add /customers to be supported by the API.
